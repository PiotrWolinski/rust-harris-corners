# Harris corner detector in rust

This is my first try on rust, so I'm just trying to check things out.  

Code is not yet complete, but harris score works just fine.  

Todo:

- [x] Perform non-maximum surpression and establish keypoints  
- [x] Mark keypoints in some visible way on the image
- [] Make keypoints more visible
- [] Add keypoints descriptor for measuring similarity between them
- [] Allow video as an input
- [] Add option to use at as a CLI app
